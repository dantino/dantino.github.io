### Here we go again

Well, here we go again. I have started and left for dead a few too many blogs and personal sites so far, but this time it surely will be different (right?). For this blog, I have shamefully borrowed some pictures from my close friend and amazing photographer [Mario Tijerina](http://www.mariotijerina.com "Mario Tijerina").    
  

What do you expect to find in this site? I expect this will center mostly on medical imaging topics and some programming rants. So, yes, another frustrated programmer's blog. I'm hoping I will be disciplined enough to maintain this site with recent publications and projects, and perhaps more importantly to complement such works with some discussions. I also expect to write one or two rants about everything that's wrong with Academia.
